Strings in Python are the way we work with text. Words, sentences, paragraphs, and even entire
files are read into and manipulated via strings. Because so much of our work revolves around text,
it is no surprise that strings are one of the most common data types.
You should remember two important things about Python string they are immutable,
and (2) in Python 3, they contain Unicode characters, encoded in UTF-8

There is no such thing as a character type in Python. We can talk about a one-character string,
but that just means a string whose length is 1. Python's strings are interesting and useful,
not only because they allow us to work with text, but also because they are a Python sequence.
This means that we can iterate over them (character by character), retrieve their elements
via numeric indexes, and search in them with the in operator.
